# Overview

Auth4Flow is an Identity and Access Management platform for the Flock Blockchain. It's designed to abstract away the complexity of implementing and managing authentication, authroization, & access control so teams can focus on building their core products.

You can use Auth4Flow to implement Blockchain Native and Walletles Onboarding authentication flows. From there you can create authorization & access control models like role based access control (RBAC), relationship based access control (ReBAC), attribute based access control (ABAC), and other custom access models.

## Key Features

* Flow Blockchain Native and Walletless Onboarding Authentication
* A centralized, managed authorization service (based on [Warrant](https://warrant.dev)) for storing and managing authorization models and their associated access rules (we call these warrants)
* Built-in support for common access models like RBAC, multi-tenancy, pricing tiers, and feature entitlements,
* Built-in support for building NFT/FT gated tenants, roles, and permissions.
* Central event log of all operations to enable easy audit logs, alerting, and debugging of authentication and authorization rules.
